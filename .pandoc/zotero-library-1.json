  {"id":"balatsouPsychologicalRealityPicture2022","abstract":"Picture name agreement is commonly used as both a control variable and independent variable in studies of language production. It describes the proportion of participants who volunteer a picture's modal name in a norming study-a population-level descriptor-but researchers often assume that name agreement also indexes cognitive processes that occur within individuals. For instance, if norms show that 50% of speakers name a picture as couch, then each time a person tries to name the picture, they might have a 50% chance of selecting couch. An alternative, however, is that name agreement may simply reflect population-level sampling of more stable individual preferences (e.g., 50% of speakers prefer the name couch), continually developed through experience. One way to distinguish between these possibilities - and assess the psychological reality of name agreement - is simply to re-norm pictures with the same individuals. In Experiment 1, we therefore collected timed naming norms for a large set of line drawings from the same 25 native British English speakers twice, 1-2 weeks apart. Results show participants' name choices in Session 2 are jointly predicted by population-level name agreement, from our previous norms, and individuals' own productions in Session 1. Experiment 2 replicated this result and further showed that prior selections predicted Session 3 outcomes better than those in Session 2, in line with an incremental learning account. This is the first direct demonstration that picture name agreement has some psychological validity, but also reveals that it does not directly index within-participant lexical competition as previously assumed.","author":[{"family":"Balatsou","given":"Evangelia"},{"family":"Fischer-Baum","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Oppenheim","given":"Gary M."}],"citation-key":"balatsouPsychologicalRealityPicture2022","container-title":"Cognition","container-title-short":"Cognition","DOI":"10.1016/j.cognition.2021.104947","ISSN":"1873-7838","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"eng","note":"8 citations (CrossRef 2025/9/23)","page":"104947","PMID":"34798508","source":"PubMed","title":"The psychological reality of picture name agreement","type":"article-journal","volume":"218"},

  {"id":"beyersmannRoleStemsPrefixes2024","abstract":"The role of stems and prefixes in complex nonword reading was investigated in unimpaired readers and five individuals with acquired dyslexia. All participants completed a reading aloud task (and the reading impaired individuals also completed a repetition task) with four different types of nonwords: prefix + stem (refront), non-prefix + stem (tefront), prefix + non-stem (refrint), non-prefix + non-stem (tefrint); and prefixed and non-prefixed filler words. The unimpaired readers responded fastest to nonwords containing two morphemes (prefix + stem), slower to nonwords with one morpheme (non-prefix + stem; prefix + non-stem), and slowest in the non-morphemic control condition (non-prefix + non-stem), providing evidence for the added benefit of prefixes and stems during reading. The five reading impaired individuals showed facilitatory morpheme effects across both tasks, but stem-effects were more robust than affix-effects. There was no difference between the prefixed and non-prefixed words in any of the data. The impact of morphological structure on nonword reading and repetition points to the important role of morphemes across different modalities..","author":[{"family":"Beyersmann","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Arrow","given":"Tara"},{"family":"Behzadnia","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Fischer-Baum","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"beyersmannRoleStemsPrefixes2024","container-title":"Cognitive Neuropsychology","container-title-short":"Cogn Neuropsychol","DOI":"10.1080/02643294.2025.2505531","ISSN":"1464-0627","issue":"7-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"eng","page":"332-358","PMCID":"PMC12309457","PMID":"40435507","source":"PubMed","title":"On the role of stems and prefixes in reading complex nonwords: Evidence from individuals with and without acquired dyslexia","title-short":"On the role of stems and prefixes in reading complex nonwords","type":"article-journal","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"blondelElementsDifferentiableProgramming2025","abstract":"Artificial intelligence has recently experienced remarkable advances, fueled by large models, vast datasets, accelerated hardware, and, last but not least, the transformative power of differentiable programming. This new programming paradigm enables end-to-end differentiation of complex computer programs (including those with control flows and data structures), making gradient-based optimization of program parameters possible. As an emerging paradigm, differentiable programming builds upon several areas of computer science and applied mathematics, including automatic differentiation, graphical models, optimization and statistics. This book presents a comprehensive review of the fundamental concepts useful for differentiable programming. We adopt two main perspectives, that of optimization and that of probability, with clear analogies between the two. Differentiable programming is not merely the differentiation of programs, but also the thoughtful design of programs intended for differentiation. By making programs differentiable, we inherently introduce probability distributions over their execution, providing a means to quantify the uncertainty associated with program outputs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Blondel","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Roulet","given":"Vincent"}],"citation-key":"blondelElementsDifferentiableProgramming2025","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2403.14606","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,24]]},"number":"arXiv:2403.14606","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Elements of Differentiable Programming","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14606"},

  {"id":"clarkSubstratePredictionRiPP2025","abstract":"We trained multiple peptide language models and demonstrated their efficacy at predicting the substrates of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) biosynthetic enzymes.\n          , \n            Ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) biosynthetic enzymes often exhibit promiscuous substrate preferences that cannot be reduced to simple rules. Large language models are promising tools for predicting the specificity of RiPP biosynthetic enzymes. However, state-of-the-art protein language models are trained on relatively few peptide sequences. A previous study comprehensively profiled the peptide substrate preferences of LazBF (a two-component serine dehydratase) and LazDEF (a three-component azole synthetase) from the lactazole biosynthetic pathway. We demonstrated that masked language modeling of LazBF substrate preferences produced language model embeddings that improved downstream prediction of both LazBF and LazDEF substrates. Similarly, masked language modeling of LazDEF substrate preferences produced embeddings that improved prediction of both LazBF and LazDEF substrates. Our results suggest that the models learned functional forms that are transferable between distinct enzymatic transformations that act within the same biosynthetic pathway. We found that a single high-quality data set of substrates and non-substrates for a RiPP biosynthetic enzyme improved substrate prediction for distinct enzymes in data-scarce scenarios.

  {"id":"englebretsonPositionPaperResearching2023","abstract":"Abstract\n            This article positions braille as a writing system worthy of study in its own right and on its own terms. We begin with a discussion of the role of braille in the lives of those who read and write it and a call for more attention to braille in the reading sciences. We then give an overview of the history and development of braille, focusing on its formal characteristics as a writing system, in order to acquaint sighted print readers with the basics of braille and to spark further interest among reading researchers. We then explore how print-centric assumptions and sight-centric motivations have potentially negative consequences, not only for braille users but also for the types of questions researchers think to pursue. We conclude with recommendations for conducting responsible and informed research about braille. We affirm that blindness is most equitably understood as but one of the many diverse ways humans experience the world. Researching braille literacy from an equity and diversity perspective provides positive, fruitful insights into perception and cognition, contributes to the typologically oriented work on the world’s writing systems, and contributes to equity by centering the perspectives and literacy of the people who read and write braille.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Englebretson","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Holbrook","given":"M.

  {"id":"fischer-baumWordDeafnessPreserved2018","abstract":"We describe the performance of an aphasic individual, K.A., who showed a selective impairment affecting his ability to perceive spoken language, while largely sparing his ability to perceive written language and to produce spoken language. His spoken perception impairment left him unable to distinguish words or nonwords that differed on a single phoneme and he was no better than chance at auditory lexical decision or single spoken word and single picture matching with phonological foils. Strikingly, despite this profound impairment, K.A. showed a selective sparing in his ability to perceive number words, which he was able to repeat and comprehend largely without error. This case adds to a growing literature demonstrating modality-specific dissociations between number word and non-number word processing. Because of the locus of K.A.'s speech perception deficit for non-number words, we argue that this distinction between number word and non-number word processing arises at a sublexical level of representations in speech perception, in a parallel fashion to what has previously been argued for in the organization of the sublexical level of representation for speech production.","author":[{"family":"Fischer-Baum","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Mis","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Dial","given":"Heather"}],"citation-key":"fischer-baumWordDeafnessPreserved2018","container-title":"Cognitive Neuropsychology","container-title-short":"Cogn Neuropsychol","DOI":"10.1080/02643294.2018.1515734","ISSN":"1464-0627","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"language":"eng","note":"7 citations (CrossRef 2025/9/23)","page":"415-429","PMCID":"PMC7065601","PMID":"30175931","source":"PubMed","title":"Word deafness with preserved number word perception","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"gehrigElectrosprayIonizationMass2000","abstract":"Electrospray ionization ~ESI! mass spectra of both well-characterized and novel metallothioneins ~MTs! from various species were recorded to explore their metal-ion-binding modes and stoichiometries. The ESI mass spectra of the zincand cadmium-binding MTs showed a single main peak corresponding to metal-to-protein ratios of 4, 6, or 7. These findings combined with data obtained by other methods suggest that these MTs bind zinc or cadmium in a single predominant form and are consistent with the presence of three- and four-metal clusters. An unstable copper-specific MT isoform from Roman snails ~Helix pomatia! could be isolated intact and was shown to preferentially bind 12 copper ions. To obtain additional information on the formation and relative stability of metal-thiolate clusters in MTs, a mass spectrometric titration study was conducted. One to seven molar equivalents of zinc or of cadmium were added to metal-free human MT-2 at neutral pH, and the resulting complexes were measured by ESI mass spectrometry. These experiments revealed that the formation of the four-metal cluster and of the thermodynamically less stable three-metal cluster is sequential and largely cooperative for both zinc and cadmium. Minor intermediate forms between metal-free MT, Me4MT, and fully reconstituted Me7MT were also observed. The addition of increasing amounts of cadmium to metal-free blue crab MT-I resulted in prominent peaks whose masses were consistent with apoMT, Cd3MT, and Cd6MT, reflecting the known structure of this MT with two Me3Cys9 centers. In a similar reconstitution experiment performed with Caenorhabditits elegans MT-II, a series of signals corresponding to apoMT and Cd3MT to Cd6MT species were observed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Gehrig","given":"Peter M."},{"family":"You","given":"Chunhui"},{"family":"Kägi","given":"Jeremias H.

  {"id":"gumperzConversationalCodeSwitching1982","abstract":"To understand the role of language in public life and the social process in general, we need first a closer understanding of how linguistic knowledge and social factors interact in discourse interpretation. This volume is a major advance towards that understanding. Professor Gumperz here synthesizes fundamental research on communication from a wide variety of disciplines - linguistics, sociolinguistics, anthropology and non-verbal communication - and develops an original and broadly based theory of conversational inference which shows how verbal communication can serve either between individuals of different social and ethnic backgrounds. The urgent need to overcome such barriers to effective communication is also a central concern of the book. Examples of conversational exchanges as well as of longer encounters, recorded in the urban United States, village Austria, South Asia and Britain, and analyzed to illustrate all aspects of the analytical approach, and to show how subconscious cultural presuppositions can damagingly affect interpretation of intent and judgement of interspeaker attitude. The volume will be of central interest to anyone concerned with communication, whether from a more academic viewpoint or as a professional working, for example, in the fields of interethnic or industrial relations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Gumperz","given":"John J."}],"citation-key":"gumperzConversationalCodeSwitching1982","container-title":"Discourse Strategies","DOI":"10.1017/CBO9780511611834","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-521-24691-0 978-0-521-28896-5 978-0-511-61183-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1982",9,30]]},"license":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","page":"59-99","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Conversational Code Switching","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9780511611834/type/book"},

Since these changes cause some investors to adjust their holdings of the affected securities and since it is unlikely that the changes convey information about the future prospects of these securities, they provide an excellent opportunity to study price pressures.

  {"id":"huntrieserIntercontinentalAirPollution2005","abstract":"During the airborne CONTRACE field experiment carried out in November 2001 a number of polluted layers of North American (NA) origin were observed in the free troposphere over Europe. For the first time, forecasts from a Lagrangian particle dispersion model were used to predict the NA pollution events and to direct a research aircraft very precisely into these polluted layers above Europe. Two of the NA pollution events are investigated here: one in detail (case 19 November) and a second more briefly (case 22 November). An exceptional result was that the first pollution plume could be traced with the model and trace gas measurements (airborne and surface) for a period of one week, from the source region over the eastern United States to its decay over the Alps. On 14–15 November a warm conveyor belt lifted the leading edge of the pollution plume over the eastern United States to the mid troposphere where it remained during the transport over the Atlantic. On 19 November the plume was intersected with the research aircraft over Scandinavia at an altitude between 2 and 4 km. Elevated CO (170), O\n              3\n              (53), NO\n              y\n              (1.1), acetone (5.0), and SO\n              2\n              (2.6) mixing ratios (nmol mol\n              −1\n              ) were measured. A positive O\n              3\n              ‐CO correlation was observed in the plume. The observations indicate that the enhanced levels of ozone were already produced near the source region over the eastern United States and not during the transit. In the next days one branch of the plume then turned to the south and descended to ground level over the Alpine region. Elevated O\n              3\n              (54 nmol mol\n              −1\n              ) and CO (168 nmol mol\n              −1\n              ) were observed at the mountain site Zugspitze (southern Germany) during two days. At the Arosa Alpine site in Switzerland the highest daily ozone means of November 2001 were observed during this event.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Huntrieser","given":"H."},{"family":"Heland","given":"J."},{"family":"Schlager","given":"H."},{"family":"Forster","given":"C."},{"family":"Stohl","given":"A."},{"family":"Aufmhoff","given":"H."},{"family":"Arnold","given":"F."},{"family":"Scheel","given":"H.

  {"id":"killingsworthExperiencedWellbeingRises2021","abstract":"Significance\n            Past research has found that experienced well-being does not increase above incomes of $75,000/y. This finding has been the focus of substantial attention from researchers and the general public, yet is based on a dataset with a measure of experienced well-being that may or may not be indicative of actual emotional experience (retrospective, dichotomous reports). Here, over one million real-time reports of experienced well-being from a large US sample show evidence that experienced well-being rises linearly with log income, with an equally steep slope above $80,000 as below it. This suggests that higher incomes may still have potential to improve people’s day-to-day well-being, rather than having already reached a plateau for many people in wealthy countries.\n          , \n            What is the relationship between money and well-being? Research distinguishes between two forms of well-being: people’s feelings during the moments of life (experienced well-being) and people’s evaluation of their lives when they pause and reflect (evaluative well-being). Drawing on 1,725,994 experience-sampling reports from 33,391 employed US adults, the present results show that both experienced and evaluative well-being increased linearly with log(income), with an equally steep slope for higher earners as for lower earners. There was no evidence for an experienced well-being plateau above $75,000/y, contrary to some influential past research. There was also no evidence of an income threshold at which experienced and evaluative well-being diverged, suggesting that higher incomes are associated with both feeling better day-to-day and being more satisfied with life overall.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Killingsworth","given":"Matthew A."}],"citation-key":"killingsworthExperiencedWellbeingRises2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"liuReweightingVisuomotorAreas2025","abstract":"Somatosensory inputs are critical to motor control. Animal studies have shown that primary somatosensory lesions cause sensorimotor deficits along with disrupted organization in primary motor cortex (M1). How does damage in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) influence motor networks in humans? Using fMRI, we examined two individuals, LS and RF, who had extensive damage to left somatosensory cortex, but primarily intact motor cortex and preserved motor abilities. Given left S1 damage, tactile detection and localization were impaired for the contralesional hand in both individuals. When moving the contralesional hand, LS, with near complete damage to S1 hand area, showed increased activation in ipsilesional putamen and deactivation in contralesional cerebellum relative to age-matched controls. These findings demonstrate influences of S1 damage to subcortical sensorimotor areas that are distant from the lesion site, and a potential reweighting of the motor network with increased action selection in putamen and inhibition of sensory prediction in cerebellum in the face of sensory loss. In contrast, RF, who had a small island of spared S1 in the hand area, showed greater activation in contralesional S1 for movement versus rest. This same region was also activated by pure somatosensory stimulation in a second experiment, suggesting that the spared S1 area in RF still subserves sensorimotor processing. Finally, the right middle occipital gyrus was more strongly activated in both individuals compared with controls, suggesting the potential reliance on visual imagery in the face of degraded sensory feedback.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Yuqi"},{"family":"Halfen","given":"Elizabeth J."},{"family":"Yau","given":"Jeffrey M."},{"family":"Fischer-Baum","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Kohler","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Faseyitan","given":"Olufunsho"},{"family":"Coslett","given":"H.

Tentative assignments to groups of multicellular algae or land plants\n            1,2,8–11\n            have been repeatedly ruled out based on anatomy and chemistry\n            5,7,11–16\n            resulting in two major alternatives:\n            Prototaxites\n            was either a fungus\n            5,6,17–22\n            or a now entirely extinct lineage\n            7,16,23\n            .

Here we test this by contrasting the anatomy and molecular composition of\n            Prototaxites\n            with contemporary fungi from the 407-million-year-old Rhynie chert. We report that\n            Prototaxites taiti\n            was the largest organism in the Rhynie ecosystem and its anatomy was fundamentally distinct from all known extant or extinct fungi. Furthermore, our molecular composition analysis indicates that cell walls of\n            P. taiti\n            include aliphatic, aromatic, and phenolic components most similar to fossilisation products of lignin, but no fossilisation products characteristic of chitin or chitosan, which are diagnostic of all groups of extant and extinct fungi, including those preserved in the Rhynie chert. We therefore conclude that\n            Prototaxites\n            was not a fungus, and instead propose it is best assigned to a now entirely extinct terrestrial lineage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Loron","given":"Corentin C."},{"family":"Cooper","given":"Laura M."},{"family":"McMahon","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Jordan","given":"Seán F."},{"family":"Gromov","given":"Andrei V."},{"family":"Humpage","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Pichevin","given":"Laetitia"},{"family":"Vondracek","given":"Hendrik"},{"family":"Alexander","given":"Ruaridh"},{"family":"Dzul","given":"Edwin Rodriguez"},{"family":"Brasier","given":"Alexander T."},{"family":"Hetherington","given":"Alexander J."}],"citation-key":"loronPrototaxitesWasExtinct2025","DOI":"10.1101/2025.03.14.643340","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,17]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","publisher":"Paleontology","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"<i>Prototaxites</i> was an extinct lineage of multicellular terrestrial eukaryotes","type":"article","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2025.03.14.643340"},

  {"id":"mankerEffectStructuralContext2016","abstract":"Phonetic accommodation is a linguistic phenomenon whereby phonetic characteristics of one’s speech are influenced by perceiving the speech of others. The last decade has seen a multitude of studies which have induced the phenomenon in a lab setting, considering the social environments necessary for facilitating or inhibiting it. No studies, however, have investigated how the perception and production of speech in different structural contexts affects phonetic accommodation. This presentation analyzes the results of an experiment that compared the frequency of phonetic accommodation in three speech settings. In condition one, subjects read aloud and shadowed entire sentences which contained artificially lengthened VOT. In condition two, subjects read short phrases and shadowed sentences, and in condition three, both read and shadowed phrases. Our results showed that speakers accommodated lengthened VOT but often also showed modified burst intensities, suggesting imprecise accommodation. More accurate VOT accommodation was observed in conditions 2 and 3 (9/12 subjects for both) compared to condition 1 (5/12 subjects). “Inaccurate” burst accommodation was more common in condition 1 (8/12) and 2 (8/12) compared to condition 3 (4/12). The results suggest that higher levels of syntactic and semantic processing (both in production and perception) may impede processing of phonetic details.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Manker","given":"Jonathan T."}],"citation-key":"mankerEffectStructuralContext2016","container-title":"Journal of the Acoustical Society of America","DOI":"10.1121/1.4950324","ISSN":"0001-4966, 1520-8524","issue":"4_Supplement","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2124-2124","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The effect of structural context on phonetic accommodation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.aip.org/jasa/article/139/4_Supplement/2124/716425/The-effect-of-structural-context-on-phonetic","volume":"139"},

  {"id":"mankerPhoneticAttentionPredictability2017","abstract":"In this dissertation, I investigate how word predictability in context modulates the listener's attention to phonetic details, and how this in turn affects sound change. Three sets of experiments are designed to investigate these questions: In the first set of experiments, involving discriminability tasks, I demonstrate that (1) contextual predictability affects speech perception, and that listeners attend more to the phonetic details of unpredictable speech. In the second set of experiments I use the phonetic accommodation paradigm to show that (2) the effect of contextual predictability on speech perception in turn affects speech production. This by itself suggests relevance in sound change. In the third set of experiments I apply the model to a specific example of sound change: the reduction of function words. Using an error detection task I show that (3) listeners attend to the details of content words more than function words (with all other variables controlled for) which is linked to their differences in contextual predictability. I then propose a two-step model of sound change involving the propagation of contextually-modulated variation with a perceptual (rather than production) bias followed by the acquisition of new variants. The results build and expand on several strands of literature which have not been fully connected previously. The findings for the effect of predictability on speech perception corroborate a number of past experiments showing that higher level linguistic information can have the effect of aiding speech recognition (Miller, Heise & Lichten 1951, Pollack & Pickett 1963), perceptually restoring missing information (Warren 1970, Marslen-Wilson, & Welsh 1978, Samuel 1981), or generally diverting attention from the raw auditory signal (Cole, Jakimik, & Cooper 1978, Ganong 1980). Additionally, this research considers dual-processing models of speech perception (Norris & Cutler 1979, Lindblom et al. 1995, Hickok and Poeppel 2004, 2007) in a broader context, considering how word predictability and expectancy modulate the type of listening used. The findings also add to the literature on exemplar theory (Johnson 1997, Pierrehumbert 2002, Goldinger 2007), particularly to hybrid models including both abstractions and exemplar clouds within the lexicon. Finally, I propose a new model of perception-based sound change driven by contextual predictability that can account for cross-linguistically common patterns of function word and morpheme reduction (Bell et al. 2001, Jurafsky et al. 2001, Beckman 1998) that does not rely on teleological production-based accounts of reduction (Lindblom 1990, Alyett & Turk 2004)","author":[{"family":"Manker","given":"Jonathan Taylor"}],"citation-key":"mankerPhoneticAttentionPredictability2017","event-place":"Ann Arbor","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"144","publisher":"University of California, Berkeley","publisher-place":"Ann Arbor","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Phonetic Attention and Predictability: How Context Shapes Exemplars and Guides Sound Change","title-short":"Phonetic Attention and Predictability","type":"thesis","URL":"www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/phonetic-attention-predictability-how-context/docview/2013309161/"},

By using a modiﬁed imitation paradigm, the current study investigated: (1) the generalizability of phonetic imitation at phoneme and sub-phonemic levels, (2) word-level speciﬁcity through acoustic measurements of speech production; and (3) automaticity of phonetic imitation and its sensitivity to linguistic structure. The sub-phonemic feature manipulated in the experiments was VOT on the phoneme /p/. The results revealed that participants produced signiﬁcantly longer VOTs after being exposed to target speech with extended VOTs. Furthermore, this modeled feature was generalized to new instances of the target phoneme /p/ and the new phoneme /k/, indicating that sub-lexical units are involved in phonetic imitation. The data also revealed that lexical frequency had an effect on the degree of imitation.

  {"id":"plattAutumnHeavenlyKingdom2012","abstract":"This narrative history of China's nineteenth-century Taiping Rebellion (which cost some twenty million lives) brims with unforgettable characters and vivid re-creations of massive and sometimes gruesome battles, in a portrait of the largest civil war in history, a conflict that shaped the fate of modern China. The story begins in the early 1850s, the waning years of the Qing dynasty, when word spread of a major revolution brewing in the provinces, led by a failed civil servant who claimed to be the son of God and brother of Jesus. The Taiping rebels drew their power from the poor and the disenfranchised, unleashing the ethnic rage of millions of Chinese against their Manchu rulers. This homegrown movement seemed all but unstoppable until Britain and the United States stepped in and threw their support behind the Manchus. After years of massive carnage, all opposition to Qing rule was effectively snuffed out for generations. Here the author recounts these events in detail, building his story on two fascinating characters with opposing visions for China's future: the conservative Confucian scholar Zeng Guofan, an accidental general who emerged as the most influential military strategist in China's modern history; and Hong Rengan, a brilliant Taiping leader whose grand vision of building a modern, industrial, and pro-Western Chinese state ended in tragic failure. This is the history of the rise and fall of the movement that, a century and a half ago, might have launched China on an entirely different path into the modern world","author":[{"family":"Platt","given":"Stephen R."}],"citation-key":"plattAutumnHeavenlyKingdom2012","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-307-27173-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Alfred A.

  {"id":"rontuCodeswitchingTriadicConversational2007","abstract":"The paper examines codeswitching in triadic conversational situations between two bilingual siblings and a parent, the mother. The children are bilingual in Finnish and (Finno-)Swedish. The study provides data on switching in an age span of 14 months between the ages of 2;8 and 5;8. The methods of the study are an analysis of the utterance production of the children, the amount and the Mean Length of Utterances (MLU). The siblings’ codeswitching is investigated within a conversational analytic approach, that is, a sequential analysis of the interaction is carried out. This analysis also includes the parent’s responses to the codeswitching. The findings show that the children’s intersentential codeswitching has a contextualized meaning in the triadic situations. Much of the codeswitching amounts to what in general terms is competition of the parent’s attention. The codeswitching has two main functions in the data. A switch to the noncontext language functions as a way to attain the mother’s attention and to break off the conversation between the other sibling and the mother. The other function of codeswitching is to emphasize the child’s own opinion or will. The emphasizing function is manifested in situations of disagreement and conflict with either the mother or the other sibling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Rontu","given":"Heidi"}],"citation-key":"rontuCodeswitchingTriadicConversational2007","container-title":"International Journal of Bilingualism","container-title-short":"International Journal of Bilingualism","DOI":"10.1177/13670069070110040101","ISSN":"1367-0069, 1756-6878","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",12]]},"language":"en","license":"https://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license","note":"10 citations (CrossRef 2025/9/23)","page":"337-358","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Codeswitching in triadic conversational situations in early bilingualism","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13670069070110040101","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"rordenUsingHumanBrain2004","abstract":"Recent technological advances, such as functional imaging techniques, allow neuroscientists to measure and localize brain activity in healthy individuals. These techniques avoid many of the limitations of the traditional method for inferring brain function, which relies on examining patients with brain lesions. This has fueled the zeitgeist that the classical lesion method is an inferior and perhaps obsolescent technique. However, although the lesion method has important weaknesses, we argue that it complements the newer activation methods (and their weaknesses). Furthermore, recent developments can address many of the criticisms of the lesion method. Patients with brain lesions provide a unique window into brain function, and this approach will fill an important niche in future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Rorden","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Karnath","given":"Hans-Otto"}],"citation-key":"rordenUsingHumanBrain2004","container-title":"Nature Reviews Neuroscience","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Neurosci","DOI":"10.1038/nrn1521","ISSN":"1471-003X, 1471-0048","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",10]]},"language":"en","license":"http://www.springer.com/tdm","note":"535 citations (CrossRef 2025/9/23)","page":"812-819","PMID":"15378041","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Using human brain lesions to infer function: a relic from a past era in the fMRI age?","title-short":"Using human brain lesions to infer function","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn1521","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"sammonIndexRebalancingStock2025","abstract":"Value-weighted indexes must rebalance in response to stock market composition changes,  e.g., issuance, buybacks, and IPOs. In doing so, existing index funds implicitly engage  in market timing. Index funds’ long-short rebalancing portfolios have an annualized  return of -4.67% and load negatively on value and profitability factors. We estimate  these trades impose a 47-70 bps annual index-level performance drag. We explore alternative value-weighted indexes that rebalance less and delay responding to compositional  changes. Despite still closely tracking the market, these indexes improve market timing  and lower trading costs, saving 50 bps annually, an order of magnitude greater than  index fund fees.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Sammon","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Shim","given":"John J."}],"citation-key":"sammonIndexRebalancingStock2025","DOI":"10.2139/ssrn.5080459","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025"]]},"publisher":"SSRN","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Index Rebalancing and Stock Market Composition: Do Index Funds Incur Adverse Selection Costs?","title-short":"Index Rebalancing and Stock Market Composition","type":"article","URL":"https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=5080459"},

Implications for the domain-generality of WM, its connection to language production, and serial order processing across cognitive functionssc are discussed.","author":[{"family":"Tian","given":"Yingxue"},{"family":"Dial","given":"Heather R."},{"family":"Martin","given":"Randi C."},{"family":"Fischer-Baum","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"tianSharedSerialOrder2025","container-title":"Cognitive Neuropsychology","container-title-short":"Cogn Neuropsychol","DOI":"10.1080/02643294.2024.2444702","ISSN":"1464-0627","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,9]]},"language":"eng","note":"2 citations (CrossRef 2025/9/23)","page":"1-30","PMID":"39787591","source":"PubMed","title":"A shared serial order system for verbal working memory and language production: evidence from aphasia","title-short":"A shared serial order system for verbal working memory and language production","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"wangHierarchicalReasoningModel2025","abstract":"Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models (LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency. Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain, we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid, detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose reasoning systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Guan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jin"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Yuhao"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xing"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Changling"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Meng"},{"family":"Song","given":"Sen"},{"family":"Yadkori","given":"Yasin Abbasi"}],"citation-key":"wangHierarchicalReasoningModel2025","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2506.21734","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,22]]},"number":"arXiv:2506.21734","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Hierarchical Reasoning Model","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734"},
  {"id":"weberAllHeartsMinds2023","abstract":"Emotions shape judgments and decisions, including actions in response to climate change. Despite growing interest in the cognitive, social, and political determinants of climate (in)action, the role of emotions has received limited attention. This review discusses the role of hope in climate action. While many emotional states are oriented to the past or present, hope offers a positive vision of the future. In exploratory analyses of a nationally representative survey of US residents, we identify the most important predictors of hope, climate action, and policy support from a large set of potential variables. We find suggestive evidence that hope, a construct comprised of cognitive, emotional, and contextual factors, is an important motivator of future-oriented action.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Weber","given":"Elke U."},{"family":"Constantino","given":"Sara M."}],"citation-key":"weberAllHeartsMinds2023","container-title":"Emotion Review","container-title-short":"Emotion Review","DOI":"10.1177/17540739231195534","ISSN":"1754-0739, 1754-0747","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10]]},"language":"en","note":"9 citations (CrossRef 2025/9/23)","page":"293-297","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"All Hearts and Minds on Deck: Hope Motivates Climate Action by Linking the Present and the Future","title-short":"All Hearts and Minds on Deck","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17540739231195534","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"woolnoughSpatiotemporalMapReading2022","abstract":"Reading words aloud is a fundamental aspect of literacy. The rapid rate at which multiple distributed neural substrates are engaged in this process can only be probed via techniques with high spatiotemporal resolution. We probed this with direct intracranial recordings covering most of the left hemisphere in 46 humans (26 male, 20 female) as they read aloud regular, exception and pseudo-words. We used this to create a spatiotemporal map of word processing and to derive how broadband γ activity varies with multiple word attributes critical to reading speed: lexicality, word frequency, and orthographic neighborhood. We found that lexicality is encoded earliest in mid-fusiform (mFus) cortex, and precentral sulcus, and is represented reliably enough to allow single-trial lexicality decoding. Word frequency is first represented in mFus and later in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior parietal sulcus (IPS), while orthographic neighborhood sensitivity resides solely in IPS. We thus isolate the neural correlates of the distributed reading network involving mFus, IFG, IPS, precentral sulcus, and motor cortex and provide direct evidence for parallel processes via the lexical route from mFus to IFG, and the sublexical route from IPS and precentral sulcus to anterior IFG.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Reading aloud depends on multiple complex cerebral computations: mapping from a written letter string on a page to a sequence of spoken sound representations. Here, we used direct intracranial recordings in a large cohort while they read aloud known and novel words, to track, across space and time, the progression of neural representations of behaviorally relevant factors that govern reading speed.

We find, concordant with cognitive models of reading, that known and novel words are differentially processed through a lexical route, sensitive to frequency of occurrence of known words in natural language, and a sublexical route, performing letter-by-letter construction of novel words.","author":[{"family":"Woolnough","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Donos","given":"Cristian"},{"family":"Curtis","given":"Aidan"},{"family":"Rollo","given":"Patrick S."},{"family":"Roccaforte","given":"Zachary J."},{"family":"Dehaene","given":"Stanislas"},{"family":"Fischer-Baum","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Tandon","given":"Nitin"}],"citation-key":"woolnoughSpatiotemporalMapReading2022a","container-title":"The Journal of Neuroscience: The Official Journal of the Society for Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J Neurosci","DOI":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2324-21.2022","ISSN":"1529-2401","issue":"27","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,6]]},"language":"eng","note":"23 citations (CrossRef 2025/9/23)","page":"5438-5450","PMCID":"PMC9270918","PMID":"35641189","source":"PubMed","title":"A Spatiotemporal Map of Reading Aloud","type":"article-journal","volume":"42"},
  {"id":"wuChineseEnglishBilinguals2010","abstract":"Bilingual individuals have been shown to access their native language while reading in or listening to their other language. However, it is unknown what type of mental representation (e.g., sound or spelling) they retrieve. Here, using event-related brain potentials, we demonstrate unconscious access to the sound form of Chinese words when advanced Chinese–English bilinguals read or listen to English words. Participants were asked to decide whether or not English words presented in pairs were related in meaning; they were unaware of the fact that some of the unrelated word pairs concealed either a sound or a spelling repetition in their Chinese translations. Whereas spelling repetition in Chinese translations had no effect, concealed sound repetition significantly modulated event-related brain potentials. These results suggest that processing second language activates the sound, but not the spelling, of native language translations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Yan Jing"},{"family":"Thierry","given":"Guillaume"}],"citation-key":"wuChineseEnglishBilinguals2010","container-title":"The Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"zhaiPrimacyTaxonomicSemantic2025","abstract":"Different organizational structures have been argued to underlie semantic knowledge about concepts; taxonomic organization, based on shared features, and thematic organization based on co-occurrence in common scenes and scenarios. The goal of the current study is to examine which of the two organizational systems are more engaged in the semantic context of a picture naming task. To address this question, we examined the representational structure underlying the semantic space in different picture naming tasks by applying representational similarity analysis (RSA) to electroencephalography (EEG) datasets. In a series of experiments, EEG signals were collected while participants named pictures under different semantic contexts. Study 1 reanalyzes existing data from semantic contexts directing attention to taxonomic organization and semantic contexts that are not biased towards either taxonomic or thematic organization. In Study 2 we keep the stimuli the same and vary semantic contexts to draw attention to either taxonomic or thematic organization. The RSA approach allows us to examine the pairwise similarity in scalp-recorded amplitude patterns at each time point following the onset of the picture and relate it to theoretical taxonomic and thematic measures derived from computational models of semantics. Across all tasks, the similarity structure of scalp-recorded neural activity correlated better with taxonomic than thematic measures, in time windows associated with semantic processing. Most strikingly, we found that the scalp-recorded patterns of neural activity between taxonomically related items were more similar to each other than the scalp-recorded patterns of neural activity for thematically related or unrelated items, even in tasks that makes thematic information more salient.
