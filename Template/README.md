# README

This Obsidian vault template is intended for general use for someone who:
1. wants to keep track of and plan how they spend their time,
2. wants to collect, record, and connect their thoughts about other published works,
3. and wants to automate or digitize one or both of the above without getting too in the weeds.

This template should work as-is for most people looking for the above, and is designed around "sensible defaults" based my own and observation of others' usage of Obsidian.

## Usage

Use periodic notes to plan goals or tasks, and record what you got up to or how you felt about that day, week, or month. Over time, this will create a neat timeline of actions / interests / ideas / people you spend time on as you link your daily work in your periodic notes. This sort of structure is helpful both to evaluate your past, and to scaffold your future, helping you stay aligned with your goals and principles.

## Plugins
