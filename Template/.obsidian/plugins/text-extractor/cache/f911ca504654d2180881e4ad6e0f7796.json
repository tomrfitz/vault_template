The structured design approach is also known as top-down design, stepwise refinement, and mod- ular programming. In structured design, the problem is divided into smaller problems. Each subproblem is then analyzed, and a solution is obtained to solve the subproblem. The solutions of all the subproblems are then combined to solve the overall problem. This process of implementing a structured design is called structured programming. OBJECT-ORIENTED DESIGN In object-oriented design (OOD), the first step in the problem-solving process is to identify the components called objects, which form the basis of the solution, and determine how these objects interact with one another. For example, suppose you want to write a program that automates the video rental process for a local video store. The two main obiects in this problem are the video and the customer.","libVersion":"0.5.0","langs":"eng"}
